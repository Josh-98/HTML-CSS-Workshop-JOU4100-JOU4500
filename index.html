            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <p>Hi and welcome to my page! My name is Joshua Ambar and I am very happy you are here. Throughout your time on this website you will learn all there is to know about me. On my site, you will learn about my life, my goals and my hobbies. Stick around and enjoy!  </p>
           
            <h2>Just a little bit of school...</h2>
            <p>When high school was coming to a close, I never really had a thought of what I wanted to do with my life so I decided to jump in a history degree at Carleton University which lasted all but two weeks. I took time off to realize I wanted to go to Algonquin College for Pre-Animation. It was a year program and I really grew my drawing skills however I did not get into Animation because my layout art was not up to standard.</p>
            <p>I looked to my hobbies to see what I wanted to do for a career and comic books came to mind. I saw that a comic book editor position requirement was a journalism degree and that made up my mind. If I had to do it all over again I would because of how much I love journalism and the program. Here are some of my articles I have written for both a newspaper and magazine:</p></p>

              <p>I have always been the creative type and wanting to put my skills to the test. I have always liked to draw, paint, colour, design rooms, design costumes and come up with stories. That is why I think I would make a great comic editor and with the help of J school I can make it there. </p>
              <p>Although I do love comics and the idea of working in the industry, another career course I would like to follow is politics. Ever since 2015, I have grown to love it and the more I think about it the more I want to become a congressman or senator.</p>
              <p>If I go the route of comics or politics I would want to live in the United States and have my career there as I love the country and oppurtunity it presents. Also, politics in the U.S. is far more interesting than in Canada I am all there for it.</p>
              <h3>Work History</h3>
              <p>Now that I gave you a run down of my school life, here is a bit about my work history. I have never worked a minimum wage job and I have worked in the hospitality industry for quite sometime. I really thrived with those type of jobs because I have a personality made for people. Although I worked in restaurants and hotels for a long time I have finally got a job that connects to what I am learning in school. Here are a list of jobs I have held:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>The Keg</li>
                <li>The Hilton Garden Inn Ottawa Airport</li>
                <li>Moxies Bar and Grill</li>
                <li>Fairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott</li>
                <li>Acart Communications for a six week internship</li>
                <li>Communications position with the Government of Canada with Shared Services Canada</li>
              </ol>
              <p>My schooling and work history has really helped me become the person I am today. Working in the hospitality industry helped my personality blossom and my schooling has allowed me to communicate better and be creative. I am ready to graduate from university and move forward with my life!</p>
