            <p>I was born September 23rd, 1998 in Ottawa, Ontario. I have 3 siblings and am the youngest in my family. When I was about three years old my family and I moved to Florida to open a restaurant and start a new life. We first lived in Westin, Florida then Jupitar and lastly Boca Raton where we stayed for the duration of 13 years. Florida was amazing and gave us so many oppurtunites over the years. Schooling was exciting, the friends were great and living three hours away from Disney was the best.</p>
            <p>My heritage is of Lebanese background and my family is Orthodox Christian. Although we arent the most connected to our culture, my family is still proud of our hertiage and delicious food that comes with it. When living in Florida, we even got involved with a Middle Eastern Orthodox community that made us feel right at home. </p>
            <p>My favorite hobbies include working out, painting, reading comics and being invested in politics. I try to maintain these hobbies to give me a break from school and work as everyone needs a break. However, lately it has been hard to keep up with them becasue of how busy life got with the last year of university. </p>
            <p>I really appreciated learning in Florida because the education system at the time taught us to be patriotic and proud of our country! My family is a proud conservative one and living in Republican Florida was perfect. My whole family intends to move back the States one day because even though we are Canadian, we have an American heart. When I was about 12 years old we decided to move back to Canada. Not because we wanted to but because our visas would not be renewed thanks to the Obama Administration.</p>
            <p>Even though Florida was all that I knew, I was excited to move back to Canada and learn about my home country and be with extended family. At first I really loved Canada, the seasons and the Harper government. I went to high school in Ottawa and it wasnt the best time because it is not as fun as high school in the States. Growing up in both countries was very beneficial because it helped shape who I am today. But since 2015, I have become very dissapointed in the country Canada has become. That is part of the reason my family and I want to move back to the States because Canada has lost its footing. But we would only live in a Republican state of course!</p>
